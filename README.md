# BiLinkedList
Simple implementation of a doubly linked list for my Fundemental Data Structures and Algorithms course in the Far Eastern University.

## Task:

Realise doubly linked list without repeats, with adding to the tail, deleting the given one, symmetrical difference.

## Functions:

isEmpty - checking for an empty list

Find - find element in list

Print - print out this list

ReversePrint - print out this reversed list

AddToEmpty - add element to an empty list

AddFirst - add element to the head

AddLast - add element to the tail

Remove - delete the given element (from any list either filled either empty)

Clear - delete all the elements from the list

Symmetric - symmetric differene of two BiLists
